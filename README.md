- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [eskom-calendar](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar/), a completely free source of Eskom Loadshedding information.
- I'm also completing my Master's in Computer Science at Stellenbosch University, South Africa

I enjoy exploring different tools, so have dabbled with a fair number of things over the years. Here's an approximate list:
- Rust, Python, Typescript, Java, Haskell, HTML/CSS, Arduino, C++
- Tailwind, Teloxide, Svelte, TensorFlow/Keras, BeautifulSoup, Godot, Shuttle.rs

Here are some ideas/concepts that I think are cool
- Regex
- [Bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)
- [bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards#The_Board_of_Sets), [smaller bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards)
- [gregarious catterpillar motion](https://youtu.be/kbFMkXTMucA)
- [how to communicate the presence of nuclear waste repositories to future generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages)
- [Shamir's secrets sharing scheme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_secret_sharing)
- [blue LEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#Blue_LED)
- [charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing)
- [the remarkably simple mechanism behind knobs and dials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer#Construction)
- Using logarithms to do multiplication without doing multiplication (Ã  la this [Welsch Labs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WY_HZUK8Q)) (also [slide rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) and analogue computers)
- The idea of the Infinite Game [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game)
  > There are at least two kinds of games: finite and infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play. Finite games are those instrumental activities - from sports to politics to wars - in which the participants obey rules, recognize boundaries and announce winners and losers. The infinite game - there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game. A finite player seeks power; the infinite one displays self-sufficient strength.

I like fixing things, so if I can take 30m to make a fix to an open source library, I usually will:

(You can use [this github search](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abeyarkay+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-repo%3Abeyarkay%2Feskom-calendar+is%3Amerged+) to see the full list of PRs I've made which were merged and which were not from my main project eskom-calendar.)

If you reach out to me, please include a Dune reference in your first message to indicate that you've read this page.

This helps me figure out who's sending a million cold calls to random people online and who's actually interested in what I have to offer.
