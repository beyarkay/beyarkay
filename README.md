I enjoy exploring different tools, so have dabbled with a fair number of things over the years. Here's an approximate list:
- Rust, Python, Typescript, Java, Haskell, HTML/CSS, Arduino, C++
- Tailwind, Teloxide, Svelte, TensorFlow/Keras, BeautifulSoup, Godot, Shuttle.rs

Here are some ideas/concepts that I think are cool
- Regex, Bloom filters, bit boards, smaller bitboards

I like fixing things, so if I can take 30m to make a fix to an open source library, I usually will:
